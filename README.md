# Peronsalized Homepage Project
This project is a website that is intended to replace the default landing page on a web browser with a customizable home page. The home page contains a google search bar to instantly search google and also allows users to login or create a profile. Once logged in, a user can personalize their home page by adding icons that sit below the google search bar and can be clicked on to instantly redirect to the desired website. 

# Requirements and Hosting
The website requires a PostgreSQL database to run and was hosted with Heroku and later Render until both services stopped providing a free tier of website hosting and PostgreSQL database hosting.
